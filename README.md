This is a simple tap tempo designed to send commnds to an ETC Ion light board, However it can be use to anything that can received osc commands. The site is themed with the logo of a theater in Escondido CA, but this could be easily swapped out or removed for your specific use case (as it is just decoration). Towards the top of app.py there are some default values that you should change for convience.
