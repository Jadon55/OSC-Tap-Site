# OSC-Tap-Site
A tap tempo for sending OSC commands, with an easy to use web interface 

This is a simple tap tempo designed to send commnds to an ETC Ion light board, However it can be use to anything that can received osc commands. The site is themed with the logo of my work, but this could be easily swapped out or removed for your specific use case. Towards the top of app.py there are some default values that you should change for convience.
